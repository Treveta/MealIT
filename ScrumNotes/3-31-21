Sprint 3
Scrum 5 (Wednesday, Submitted as Scrum 4 on Canvas)

Casey
  Did: Replaced calendar component uid with clickable button that opens recipe dialog.
  Plans to Do: actually getting the information to display.
  Obstacles: not now.

Daymion
  Did: JSDocs and tested function for moving things to food storage. Came up with idea for Reserved List.
  Plans to Do: cleanup on foodStorage?
  Obstacles: none.

Ira
  Did:
    Massive upheaval of item-list-component.spec.ts testing, migrated several tests to the service, changed values acccordingly.
      Deleted consolidation tests from item list spec as they are now being done in the service.
    AddToItemList calls the service for most of its things, but the tests still exists since item list component was built on 
    class variables.
    Added testing of the actual user story task inside of the openDialog testing on Calendar component.
    General cleanup: fixing and updating faulty JSDocs on tests, moving its in the item list spec file into describes.
  Plans to Do:
    testing a service and testing calls to a service is a bit unknwon, though seeing openDialog's example help some. 
    tests or testing itself likely would fail. 
  Obstacles:
    Testing services
      How to actually set a spy on a service? (learned something from openDialog)
      Numerical analysis Exam is Friday, will probably not get final user story of warning dialog done before end of sprint.

Derek
  Did: not a ton. General cleanup of tests and documentation.
  Plans to Do: moving on to meal plans respond to any day you're in.
  Obstacles: Work.
