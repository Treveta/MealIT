Sprint 3
Scrum 5 (Wednesday, Submitted as Scrum 4 on Canvas)

Casey
  Did: Nothing. Personal reasons.
  Plans to Do: get correct information. complete open recipe dialog for Monday.
  Obstacles: not now.

Daymion
  Did: Created a toStorage function but is unable to save things to the foodStorageList
  Plans to Do: testing, peer review. displaying foodStorage
  Obstacles: Bug in HTML. removes items before it sends things to foodStorageList. unable to save things to the foodStorageList

Ira
  Did:
    Massive upheaval of item-list-component.spec.ts testing, migrated several tests to the service, changed values acccordingly.
      Deleted consolidation tests from item list spec as they are now being done in the service.
    AddToItemList calls the service for most of its things, but the tests still exists since item list component was built on 
    class variables.
    Added testing of the actual user story task inside of the openDialog testing on Calendar component.
    General cleanup: fixing and updating faulty JSDocs on tests, moving its in the item list spec file into describes.
  Plans to Do:
    testing a serice and testing calls to a service is a bit unknwon, though seeing openDialog's example help some. 
    tests or testing itself likely would fail. 
  Obstacles:
    Testing services
      shoppinglistEditService tests aren't being run at all?
      How to actually set a spy on a service? (learned something from openDialog)
      Numerical analysis Exam is Friday, will probably not get final user story of warning dialog done before end of sprint.

Derek
  Did: Commented and tested stuff from last week. those two user stories are ready for peer review.
  Plans to Do: moving on to meal plans respond to any day you're in
  Obstacles: None.
